# Description
  Implemented dynamic front-end and back-end application using plain javascript(jquery as well), node.js and mysql.

  Instead of classic sql queries, I used `sequelize.js` to syncronize mysql into nodejs. This way, I could use more readable queries which is similar to mongo queries(native mongo, mongoose).

  Used asyncronous methods and error handlers...

  Proper project structure...

  Easy setup...

  Slightly better front-end design.

  Dynamic, reusable and readable functions...
